What I looked at or tried to implement
---------------------------------------
1. Billboarding to increase framerate (unsuccessful due to it being too complicated)
2. Perlin noise to generate terrain (unsuccessful due to it being too complicated)
3. Shadows (unsuccessful due to framerate)
4. Normals for hills (unsuccessful due to it being too complicated)
5. Trees and buildings at correct elevations (unsuccessful due to it being too complicated)
